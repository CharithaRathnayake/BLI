# Bilingual Lexicon Induction (BLI) Evaluation Datasets  

This repository contains the evaluation dictionaries created for the paper *"Unsupervised Bilingual Lexicon Induction for Low-Resource Languages."* These datasets were designed for evaluating BLI performance on two low-resource language pairs: English-Punjabi (EnPj) and English-Sinhala (EnSi).  

## Datasets Overview  

### English-Punjabi (EnPj)  
For the EnPj language pair, a single evaluation dataset was created.  

### English-Sinhala (EnSi)  
For the EnSi language pair, one evaluation dataset was created using the Google Translation tool.  

The process of creating these datasets, including the thresholds and methodologies used, is detailed in the paper.  

## How to Use  
- Each dataset is provided in a standard format for easy integration with BLI models.  
- Refer to the paper for details on the dataset creation process and the evaluation framework.  

We hope these resources will contribute to further advancements in BLI research for low-resource languages.
