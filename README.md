# Bilingual Lexicon Induction (BLI) Evaluation Datasets  

This repository contains the evaluation dictionaries created for the paper *"Unsupervised Bilingual Lexicon Induction for Low-Resource Languages."* These datasets were designed for evaluating BLI performance on two low-resource language pairs: English-Punjabi (EnPj) and English-Sinhala (EnSi).  

## Datasets Overview  

### English-Punjabi (EnPj)  
For the EnPj language pair, a single evaluation dataset was created.  

### English-Sinhala (EnSi)  
For the EnSi language pair, three evaluation datasets are included:  
1. **Google Translation-Based Dataset**: Generated using the Google Translation tool.  
2. **Human-Created High-Frequency Dataset**: Manually created for high-frequency words.  
3. **Human-Created Low-Frequency Dataset**: Manually created for low-frequency words.  

The process of creating these datasets, including the thresholds and methodologies used, is detailed in the paper.  

## How to Use  
- Each dataset is provided in a standard format for easy integration with BLI models.  
- Refer to the paper for details on the dataset creation process and the evaluation framework.  

We hope these resources will contribute to further advancements in BLI research for low-resource languages.
